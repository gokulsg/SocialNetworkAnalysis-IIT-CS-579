3		7		@michael_nielsen our bodies are too damn efficient. A really good feature until recently, a cruel bug since.
0		6		dismayed with how much boring/basic furniture is out there &amp; how hard it is to find alternatives. Why get a lamp you can't even ssh into

And who do "we" look like?
0		2		@deanpomerleau @SCSatCMU @jackclarkSF and by "discussed" you must mean "harshly criticized"
0		2		@deanpomerleau it was akin to what we now call "target prop". It's equivalent to backprop in the small error limit.
